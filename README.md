- Today's programming wisdom is:

"Premature optimization is the root of all evil." - Donald Knuth

This quote emphasizes that over-concern with optimizing code before it's necessary can lead to complex, hard-to-maintain code and might divert attention from more critical design issues. It suggests that programmers should focus first on writing clear, correct, and working code, then optimize only when there's evidence that a specific part of the codebase is causing performance bottlenecks. This principle promotes better program design and maintainability in the long run.
